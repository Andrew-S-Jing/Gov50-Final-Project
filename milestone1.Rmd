I plan on using Harvard Open Data Project and Harvard Public Opinion Project data to run analysis on educational racial inequities in colleges/Harvard. These two groups both publish their datasets, and I would easily be able to reach out for that data. I might explore trends relating race and many other variables: type of education (public/private), family socioeconomic background, geographical background, legacy status, athletic status, and a host of other variables.
At this point, I don't know what type of trends I am looking for, or if approaching data analysis with a specific goal is a good idea at all. However, my goal for this project is to present higher education institutions (maybe just Harvard) with more insight into the overall demographics of their communities, and whether or not specific demographic groups are often correlated with other specific factors.
